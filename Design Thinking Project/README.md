## Reflection
This Design Thinking project proved to be a valuable learning experience for us because it has allowed us to recognize the way real-world problems can be solved by shifting the focus to the needs and perspectives of the user. Empathy, Define, Idealate, Prototype, and Test, the four processes in the Design Thinking cycle, taught us that the best way to proceed with problem-solving is not by making assumptions, but by grasping the needs and frustrations the user faces. Conversations with the user made us realize the challenges that customers and barbers face in regard to management, trust, and decision-making.
