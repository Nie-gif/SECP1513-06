## Reflection

From the UTM Digital visit, I learned that being in the computing field is not only about coding, but also about having strong management skills to  complete projects effectively. The visit opened my eyes on how broad and diverse the computing field is. This experience significantly changed my perspective and helped me better understand the demands of a career in computing.
